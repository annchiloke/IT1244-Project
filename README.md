# IT1244 Project: Predicting Fraud in Electricity and Gas Consumption

**Project Repository for IT1244 Artificial Intelligence: Technology and Impact**

All code files are stored in the **code** folder.

All datasets and saved models are stored the **data** folder.

## Instructions

### 1. Install All the Required Packages

Install all the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt`.

### 2. Running the Project

**Option A**: Run everything from scratch

1. Run `data_preprocessing.ipynb` in the **code** folder.

2. Train individual models (located in the **code** folder):

    a. `lightgbm.ipynb`

    b. `logistic regression.ipynb`

    c. `random forest.ipynb`

    d. `SVM.ipynb`

3. Run `comparing_models.ipynb` in **code** folder.

**Option B**: Use saved models

1. Run `data_preprocessing.ipynb` in the **code** folder.

2. Run `comparing_models.ipynb` in **code** folder.

    - This will use the saved models from the **data** folder to reproduce the results without retraining.
